🚦 Smart City Traffic Analyzer
🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build an automated data pipeline that analyzes real or simulated traffic data to identify traffic patterns, predict congestion hotspots, and pinpoint peak hours. This solution demonstrates Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with integration into a MySQL database—showcasing skills in data modeling, time-series analysis, and data engineering.

🌟 Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation Generates realistic, simulated traffic data with fluctuations in vehicle count and speed over a 30-day period.

Data Transformation Cleans and enriches data by handling missing values, validating entries, and creating derived features such as:

hour_of_day
day_of_week
traffic_category
Database Loading Loads the cleaned and transformed data into a normalized MySQL schema containing:

locations table
traffic_data table
Modular ETL Pipeline Organized into clearly defined functions for each stage (Extract, Transform, Load), ensuring scalability, readability, and easy maintenance.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Component	Technology
Language	Python 3.x
Database	MySQL
Libraries	pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, pymysql, cryptography
Python Library Roles:
pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
numpy – Numerical operations
sqlalchemy – ORM and database connection
pymysql – MySQL database driver
cryptography – Required for secure authentication with MySQL
⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed
MySQL server running locally
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy pymysql cryptography
💡 Note: cryptography is required by pymysql for certain authentication methods.

3. Database Setup
Connect to MySQL using a client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command line, etc.).

Execute the SQL commands found in schema.sql to create:

traffic_db database
Required tables (locations, traffic_data)
4. Configure Database Credentials
Open traffic_analyzer_etl.py and update the MySQL configuration:

mysql_config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'your_password',  # <-- Update this
    'database': 'traffic_db'
}
▶️ How to Run
Navigate to the project directory:

cd smart_city_traffic_analyzer
Execute the ETL script:

python traffic_analyzer_etl.py
The script will:
Generate a synthetic dataset (traffic_data.csv)

Clean and transform the data

Load the data into MySQL tables:

locations
traffic_data
You can then query and analyze the dataset directly from your MySQL client.

📊 Example Use Cases
Identify traffic congestion patterns over time
Predict peak traffic hours
Analyze location-based speed trends
Support urban planning decisions with data-driven insights
